Class Notes for Reactive Spring 
===============================
Dave Carlson <davicar319@acm.org>


O'Reilly with Ken Kousen

Spring uses project reactor.io 
* Can be used outside of Spring.
* Spring can also use JavaRx

Reactive Spring involves creating a lot of complexity, Ken thinks that this is often not worth 
it. It is way more efficient, but way more complex.

No one would create a new Spring application without using Spring Boot. Nor would anyone take a legacy application and rewrite to to Spring Boot.
